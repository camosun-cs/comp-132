		<h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>
		<p>In this lab assignment you will practice:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating and modifying arrays</li>
			<li>Passing arrays as method parameters</li>
			<li>Traversing multi-dimensional arrays</li>
			<li>Making aggregate calculations using array values</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Reverse order</h2>
		<p>Write a program that will ask the user to enter a series of integers and then print them back in reverse order.</p>
		<p>Your program should start by asking <em>how many</em> numbers will be entered, then use a loop to collect them from <code class="language-java">System.in</code> and store them in an array.</p>
		<p>For extra WOW marks, use methods to modularize your code.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 2: Repeated multiplications</h2>
		<p>Write a method that accepts an array of integers as a parameter and replaces each value with the result of multiplying that value by all previous values in the array.</p>
		<p>For example, the array <code class="language-java">[2, -3, 4, -5]</code> would be changed to <code class="language-java">[2, -6, -24, 120]</code>.</p>
		<p>Write a second method that performs the same work, but returns a new array with the new values rather than modifying the input array.</p>
		<aside>Hint: use the first method from inside the second method to avoid duplicate code!</aside>
		<p>Use the <samp>main</samp> method of your program to test both of your other methods using several different arrays.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="task3">
		<h2>Task 3: Class statistics</h2>
		<p>Write a program that will process a list of students' grades to calculate a <abbr title="Grade point average">GPA</abbr> for each student and the class average.</p>
		<p>Your program will need to take in two chunks of data stored as two-dimensional arrays:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Student names, stored as an array of [<samp>Lastname</samp>, <samp>First name</samp>] arrays.</li>
			<li>Grades for each assignment, stored as an array of arrays of doubles.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The two arrays store data for the same student at equivalent indexes. That is, index 0 in both arrays holds data for the first student, index 1 in both arrays holds data for the second, etc.</p>
		<p>Use the following input from your main method to test your program:</p>
		<pre><code class="language-java">
			String[][] names = {
				{ "Ewell", "Nate" },
				{ "Smurthwaite", "Adelina" },
				{ "Bernollet", "Maryjane" },
				{ "Chalfain", "Karlis" },
				{ "Huckabe", "Almire" }
			};
			double[][] grades = {
				{ 3.83, 9.21, 9.25, 0.84, 1.40, 7.90, 1.41, 5.15 },
				{ 5.09, 3.66, 3.04, 3.02, 8.59, 2.34, 8.86, 7.40 },
				{ 5.35, 0.85, 8.56, 7.37, 2.78, 3.19, 2.04, 5.70 },
				{ 9.25, 9.62, 7.08, 7.27, 9.86, 5.88, 9.86, 9.70 },
				{ 3.39, 2.75, 1.23, 1.04, 3.87, 8.72, 4.60, 6.21 }
			};
		</code></pre>
		<p>Using these input values, your program should output:</p>
		<samp><pre>Student GPAs:
Nate Ewell: 4.87
Adelina Smurthwaite: 5.25
Maryjane Bernollet: 4.48
Karlis Chalfain: 8.57
Almire Huckabe: 3.98

Class average: 5.43</pre></samp>
		<details>
			<summary>More test data</summary>
			<p>If you would like some more sample data to test with, use this method to generate additional grades:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-java">
			public static double[][] generateMarks(int students, int assignments) {
				double[][] grades = new double[students][assignments];
				for (int i = 0; i < students; i++) {
					for (int j = 0; j < assignments; j++) {
						grades[i][j] = (Math.random() * 10);
					}
				}
				return grades;
			}
			</code></pre>
			<p>You will probably also want to write a method to print this table of grades so that you can check your results!</p>
		</details>

	<section id="submission">
		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>
			Completing all of the tasks in this lab should result in three
			separate Java files	within a single package. Compress the package
			directory into a ZIP archive and <b>upload it</b> to the D2L Dropbox.
			Make sure the filename includes your name and lab number, for example
			<kbd>Lab6-JohnSmith.zip</kbd>. In addition, <b>print out your code</b>
			and hand in the physical copy at the beginning of the next lab session.
		</p>
		<p>
			The marks for this lab are heavily weighted towards good coding
			practice and style. Pay attention to each of the points in the
			marking criteria below to ensure you get a good grade!
		</p>
		<p>
		   <b>NOTE</b>: This assignment is to be done <em>individually</em>.
		   You can help one another with problems and questions, but in the end
		   everyone must do their own assignment.
