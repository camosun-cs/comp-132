		<h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>

		<p>In this lab you will create three small programs using what you've learned about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code class="language-java">if</code>,
				<code class="language-java">else</code>,
				and <code  class="language-java">switch</code> statements
			</li>
			<li>
				Conditional operators
				(<code  class="language-java">&&</code>,
				<code class="language-java">||</code>,
				<code class="language-java">!</code>)
			</li>
			<li>Good coding style</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			You will also learn how to create random numbers using
			<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html#random()"><code>Math.random()</code></a>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Double The Number</h2>

		<p>Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number within the range of 0 to 100. Your program should output twice the amount given.</p>

		<p>Your approach should be something like:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Prompt the user to enter a number between 0 to 100.</li>
			<li>Check that the user entered a number in the correct range (and display an error message if appropriate).</li>
			<li>Multiply the given number by two.</li>
			<li>Display the result.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 2: Play The Lottery</h2>

		<p>Write a program to run a simple lottery. The program should randomly generate a lottery number between 0 and 99, prompt the user to enter a guess, and determine the user's winnings according to the following rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the user input matches the lottery number exactly, the award is $10,000.</li>
			<li>If the user enters the correct digits, but in the wrong order, the award is $3000.</li>
			<li>If the lottery number has two digits and the user's guess contains just one of them, the award is $1000.</li>
			<li>In all other cases, there is no award.</li>
		</ul>
		<aside>Remember to check that the user input is within the range you expect for this lottery.</aside>
		<details>
			<summary>Generating random numbers</summary>
			<p>The code to generate a random number for this task is as follows:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-java">int lottery = (int)(Math.random()*100);</code></pre>
			<p><code>Math.random()</code> generates a random positive <code>double</code> value between 0 and 1 (eg. 0.1, or 0.75639). The value <em>may</em> be exactly 0, but will <em>never</em> be exactly 1. When multiplied by 100, this transforms it to a range from 0 up to but not including 100 (although it could be 99.99999). Any decimal portion of the value will be dropped when cast to an <code>int</code>, leaving you with a random integer value between 0 and 99 (inclusive).</p>
			<p>You can use <code>Math.random()</code>, along with a little bit of math and type casting, to generate any range of random values that you need. For example, you could get a random multiple of 3 between 15 and 150 with <code class="language-java">3 * ((int)(Math.random() * 46) + 5)</code>.</p>
		</details>

	<section id="task3">
		<h2>Task 3: Find My Team</h2>

		<p>Prompt the user to enter a team number. Use a switch statement to find the appropriate league name for that team and print it to the screen. The teams are grouped into the following leagues:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Junior" league: teams 1, 2, 3, and 6.</li>
			<li>"Amateur" league: teams 8, and 9.</li>
			<li>"Special" league: teams 4, 7, and 11.</li>
			<li>"Major" league: teams 5, 10, and 12 through 14.</li>
			<li>Any other team number: "Unassigned".</li>
		</ul>
		<aside>Remember that you can use the "fall-through" behavior of the switch statement to group related cases together and avoid code duplication. Also, cases do not have to be in numerical order!</aside>

	<section id="submission">
		<h2>Submission</h2>

		<p>
			Completing all three tasks should result in three separate Java files
			within a single package. Compress the package directory into a ZIP
			archive and <b>upload it</b> to the D2L Dropbox.  Make sure the filename
			includes your name and lab number, for example <kbd>Lab3-JohnSmith.zip</kbd>.
			In addition, <b>print out your code</b> and hand in the physical copy
			at the beginning of the next lab.
		</p>
		<p>
			The marks for this lab are heavily weighted towards good coding
			practice and style. Pay attention to each of the points in the
			table below to ensure you get a good grade!
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTE</b>: This assignment is to be done <em>individually</em>.
			You can help one another with problems and questions, but in the end
			everyone must do their own assignment.
