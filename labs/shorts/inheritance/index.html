		<h2>Task</h2>
		<p>Create a hierarchy of classes that extend your <samp>Person</samp> class from the previous lab.</p>
		<p>Your submission should include the package containing the three new classes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><samp>Student</samp> (subclass of <samp>Person</samp>)</li>
			<li><samp>GraduateStudent</samp> (subclass of <samp>Student</samp>)</li>
			<li><samp>Employee</samp> (subclass of <samp>Person</samp>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Import</em> your existing <samp>Person</samp> class rather than recreating it in this new package.</p>

		<p>Your submission should demonstrate an understanding of:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>how to use <strong>extends</strong></li>
			<li>using <strong>super()</strong> to invoke the parent's constructor</li>
			<li>using inherited variables and methods</li>
			<li><strong>overriding</strong> inherited methods</li>
		</ul>

	</section>

	<section id="submission">
		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>
			Submit a ZIP archive of your package folder to the
			"Inheritance Exercise" assignment on D2L.
		</p>
		<p><strong>You do not need to include your <samp>Person</samp> class.</strong></p>
		<p>
			This assignment must be handed in individually, but you are
			encouraged to work together in groups and share code with one
			another to help you to understand the concepts!
		</p>
		<p>
			You will receive a 100% completion mark as long as you hand in
			some code that demonstrates your understanding of the exercise.
		</p>
