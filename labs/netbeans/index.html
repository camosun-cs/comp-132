		<h2>Setup: Installing NetBeans</h2>
		<p>If you are working in a computer lab at Camosun, simply log in using your Camosun ID. NetBeans will already be installed for you and you can skip this section.</p>
		<p>If you would like to use NetBeans on your own computer, you'll need to install it yourself! Follow the instructions in this section to get it set up.</p>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>Go to <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org">netbeans.apache.org</a> in a web browser.</li>
			<li>Choose <samp>Download</samp> from the main navigation menu.</li>
			<li>Choose the link for "binaries." At the time these instructions were written, the link looks like "incubating-netbeans-10.0-bin.zip."</li>
			<li>Click the suggested download link at the top of the page, and wait for the download to complete.</li>
			<li>
				<p>If you are using MacOS,</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Double-click the downloaded ZIP file to extract its contents.</li>
					<li>Open the "netbeans" folder, and open the "bin" folder inside of it.</li>
					<li>Right-click the "netbeans" file with the black icon and choose "Open".</li>
					<li>A security warning likely appear; this is normal! Choose "Open" to proceed.</li>
					<li>In the future, you can double-click this file to open NetBeans and the security warning will no longer appear.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If you are using Windows,</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the downloaded file.</li>
					<li>Choose "Extract All" from the ribbon and follow the prompts.</li>
					<li>Open the extracted "netbeans" folder, and open the "bin" folder inside of it.</li>
					<li>Double click "netbeans64.exe" to open NetBeans for the first time.</li>
					<li>If this doesn't work, try "netbeans.exe" instead.</li>
					<li>In the future, NetBeans should appear in your start menu, but you can always start it by opening this file.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>NetBeans may ask you to download Java SE components the first time it is opened, or the first time you start a new project. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.</li>
		</ol>

	<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: NetBeans and Java basics</h2>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>Launch NetBeans</li>
			<li>In NetBeans, go to <samp>File > New Project</samp></li>
			<li>In the New Project window, select <samp>Java</samp> from the Categories pane and <samp>Java Application</samp> from the Projects pane, then click <samp>Next</samp></li>
			<li>Change the Project Name to <kbd>java-lab-assignments</kbd>, or something similar. This project will be used for all of your lab assignments for this course.</li>
			<li>Change the Project Location to your M drive. This will ensure that your files are available from any lab computer.</li>
			<li>Uncheck the <samp>Create Main Class</samp> checkbox.</li>
			<li>Click Finish.</li>
			<li>
				Outside of NetBeans, go back to your M drive.
				Notice that NetBeans has created a new folder here with the name of your project.
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Open the project folder, and navigate to the <samp>src</samp> folder inside. This is where the Java files you write will be stored (your "source code"). It's empty right now because we haven't yet written any code!</p>
				<details>
					<summary>What are all these other files?</summary>
					<p>The <samp>build.xml</samp> tells NetBeans how to compile and package your project's code.</p>
					<p>The <samp>nbproject</samp> folder contains files that NetBeans uses to keep track of your project settings, as well as additional build scripts referenced by the <samp>build.xml</samp> file.</p>
					<p>The <samp>manifest.mf</samp> contains metadata about your project that Java may need when your code runs.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Download the sample code below and move it into your <samp>src</samp> folder.</p>
				<a class="sample language-java" href="NetBeansIntro.java" download>Download Sample</a>
			</li>
			<li>Back in NetBeans, you should now see <samp>NetBeansIntro.java</samp> appear in the <samp>Projects</samp> pane. It will be filed under <samp>&lt;default package&gt;</samp> in the <samp>Source Packages</samp> group.</li>
			<li>This example code belongs in a <em>package</em> named <samp>examples</samp>, but we've put it into the "default" package. Open the file in NetBeans and click on the lightbulb in the margin on line 1. Choose <samp>Move class to correct folder</samp>.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Look back at your <samp>src</samp> folder outside of NetBeans. You should now see an <samp>examples</samp> folder, and NetBeans has moved <samp>NetBeansIntro.java</samp> into it.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Why use packages?</summary>
					<p>Packages help to keep your code organized by keeping related files together. You will store all of your Java code in this course together in one project, but should use a separate package (really just a folder inside of <samp>src</samp>) for each lab assignment to keep their files separated and make it easy to ZIP them up for submission to D2L.</p>
				</details>
				<p>As you've seen, NetBeans can manage your files from within the IDE, or you can manage them directly in the <samp>src</samp> folder. Either approach is fine!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The little red exclamation badges in the <samp>Projects</samp> panel and editor pane are indicating that the <samp>NetBeansIntro.java</samp> file we added still has errors. We cannot compile or run our code until all of these warnings are fixed. Hover your mouse over the red icons to find out what the problems are, or open the Action Items panel (choose <samp>Window</samp> > <samp>Action Items</samp> from the menu) for a full list.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>What does this error mean!?</summary>
					<p>The error messages you get from the Java can be quite cryptic, especially when you're just starting to program. They tend to be very short, and use a lot of specialized jargon.</p>
					<p>Do not depair! You will learn what a lot of this jargon means throughout this course, and as you get more experienced, just knowing <em>where</em> the error occurs can often be enough for you to spot the problem.</p>
					<p>In the meantime, the most common errors you will see when you are just beginning will be:</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>â€¦ expected</dt>
						<dt>not a statement</dt>
						<dt>reached end of file while parsing</dt>
						<dd>Something is wrong with your syntax. Check for missing semi-colons and braces.</dd>
						<dt>cannot find symbol</dt>
						<dd>You probably misspelled something. This can also happen if you've forgotten to define a variable before using it.</dd>
						<dt>incompatible type</dt>
						<dd>You've probably forgotten to use quotes around a string value, put quotes around a number when you shouldn't have, or used single-quotes when you should have used double-quotes. This error will come up for many more situations as you learn to do more with Java.</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>Mindprod.com has a <a href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/compileerrormessages.html">nice big list of compilation errors and their likely causes</a> that might also be helpful.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Fix the error in the sample code by removing the line that says "Opps!" (line 4), and save your changes.</li>
			<li>Look back at your project folder on your M drive. There should now be a <samp>build</samp> folder next to your <samp>src</samp> in the project directory. This is where NetBeans stores your compiled code. By default, NetBeans will automatically compile your Java source code into runnable <samp>.class</samp> files any time you save the file or attempt to run it.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Run the example program by opening it in the NetBeans editor and choosing <samp>Run</samp> > <samp>Run File</samp> from the menu.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Why can't I use the big green <samp>Run Project</samp> button?</summary>
					<p>Projects are normally meant to store just one program, and so this button will only run the main method in <em>one</em> of your Java files (called the "main class"). Right now that's fine, but as you add more files to this project it will quickly become less useful.</p>
					<p>If you really like using that button instead of the menu or hotkeys, you can change which class will be run at any time in the settings for your project. Right-click the project name in the Projects panel and choose <samp>Properties</samp>. Choose <samp>Run</samp> from the <samp>Categories</samp> pane and change the <samp>Main Class</samp> setting as appropriate.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If everything is working normally, you should the following appear in the output panel:</p>
				<pre><span style="color:gray">run:</span>
Success?
<span style="color:green">BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 0 seconds)</span></pre>
				<p>The black text is the output from this program. The coloured bits are messages from NetBeans letting you know where this output came from, and whether everything was working normally or not.</p>
