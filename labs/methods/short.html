		<h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>
		<p>In this lab assignment you will learn about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating and using methods</li>
			<li>Passing parameters and receiving return values</li>
			<li>Splitting code into small reusable components</li>
			<li>JavaDoc comments</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Restructure "Days in a Month"</h2>
		<p>Transform the "Days in a Month" code from Lab 3, Task 1 to use a method.</p>
		<p>Your main method should handle all input and output. Move the rest of the code into a new <code>daysInMonth</code> method and use parameters and return values to communicate with the main method.</p>
		<p>Make sure to include JavaDoc comments for your new method!</p>
	</section>

	<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 2: Restructure "Play The Lottery"</h2>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>
				<p>Recreate your "Play The Lottery" program from Lab 3 Task 2 using methods.</p>
				<p>Your program should be composed of at least 4 different methods:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a method that generates a lottery number</li>
					<li>a method that prompts the user for a guess and ensures that their input is valid</li>
					<li>a method that compares a guess to a lottery number and determines whether or not the guess was correct (or partially correct)</li>
					<li>the <code>main</code> method which controls the flow of the program and determines how much money should be awarded</li>
				</ul>
				<aside>
					Hint: use some <code class="language-java">static final</code> constant numbers as return values from your guess-checking method to
					signal the different kinds of win or loss conditions.
				</aside>
			</li>
			<li>
				Write appropriate JavaDoc comments for all of your methods and static variables.
			</li>
			<li>
				Modify your <code>main</code> method to allow the player to make multiple guesses against the same lottery number.
				The player should be given a greater reward for matching the lottery number in fewer guesses.
				Try to limit your changes to the <code>main</code> method; if you can't, look for ways to refactor your other methods
				so you could use the same code for both versions of the game!
			</li>

		<h2>Submission and Grading</h2>
		<p>
			Completing all tasks in this lab should result in <em>two</em> separate Java files within a single package. Compress the package directory into a ZIP archive and submit it to the Lab 5 - Methods and Modularization assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your lab package must be named following the normal convention for labs (<samp>LastnameFirstname_lab5</samp>), or it will not be marked.
