		<h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>
		<p>In this lab assignment you will learn about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaDoc comments</li>
			<li>Creating and using methods</li>
			<li>Passing parameters and receiving return values</li>
			<li>Splitting code into small reusable components</li>
			<li>Overloading methods</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Restructure Find My Team</h2>
		<p>Transform your "Find My Team" code from Lab 3, Task 3 to use a method.</p>
		<p>Your main method should prompt the user for a team number and print out the result league to the screen. Move the rest of the code into a new <code>findTeam</code> method and use parameters and return values to communicate with the main method.</p>
		<p>Make sure to include JavaDoc comments for your new method!</p>
	</section>

	<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 2: Change Machine</h2>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>
				<p>Transform your code for calculating change from Lab 2 (Task 2: Math with Money) to use methods.</p>
				<p>Your main method should handle all user input and output to the screen. The actual calculation of change should be performed by a new method called <code>makeChange</code> which takes in an amount as a <code class="language-java">double</code> and returns a description of the resulting change as a <code class="language-java">String</code>.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Starter code</summary>
					<p>If you don't have functional code from Lab 2 to start with, you can use this version instead:</p>
					<a class="sample language-java" href="MakeChange.java" download>Download starter code</a>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				Add a JavaDoc comment for your <code>makeChange</code> method. The comment should minimally include descriptions of the method's
				purpose, its input parameter, and it's return value.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add static variables to keep track of the total number of each kind of coin your change machine has in stock.
				For example, if your change machine returns dimes and pennies, add a <code class="language-java">static int dimes</code> and a <code class="language-java">static int pennies</code> to your code.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add a <code>restock</code> method that sets the static coin counts to reasonable starting amounts, and use it from your
				main method to initialize them. The <code>restock</code> method should not need any input parameters or a return value.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add JavaDoc comments for each of your static variables and the <code>restock</code> method.
			</li>
			<li>
				Modify your <code>makeChange</code> code to decrement the coin stock counts by however many coins it uses.
				For example, if the method returns "2 dimes, and 3 pennies", it should decrement your <code>dimes</code> variable
				by 2, and your <code>pennies</code> variable by 3.
				If there are no longer enough coins available in the stock to make change, <code>makeChange</code> should return an error
				message instead of the change amounts. For example, if you run out of dimes, the method might return
				"Not enough dimes to make change."
			</li>
			<li>
				Update the JavaDoc comments for your change method to make note of the changed behaviour.
			</li>
		</ol>

	<section id="task3">
		<h2>Task 3: Restructure "Play The Lottery"</h2>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>
				<p>Recreate your "Play The Lottery" program from Lab 3 Task 2 using methods.</p>
				<p>Your program should be composed of at least 4 different methods:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a method that generates a lottery number</li>
					<li>a method that prompts the user for a guess and ensures that their input is valid</li>
					<li>a method that compares a guess to a lottery number and determines whether or not the guess was correct (or partially correct)</li>
					<li>the <code>main</code> method which controls the flow of the program and determines how much money should be awarded</li>
				</ul>
				<aside>
					Hint: use some <code class="language-java">static final</code> constant numbers as return values from your guess-checking method to
					signal the different kinds of win or loss conditions.
				</aside>
			</li>
			<li>
				Write appropriate JavaDoc comments for all of your methods and static variables.
			</li>
			<li>
				Modify your <code>main</code> method to allow the player to make multiple guesses against the same lottery number.
				The player should be given a greater reward for matching the lottery number in fewer guesses.
				Try to limit your changes to the <code>main</code> method; if you can't, look for ways to refactor your other methods
				so you could use the same code for both versions of the game!
			</li>
			<li>
				Bonus: overload your lottery number generator and guess checker methods with new versions
				that can handle lottery numbers with a configurable number of digits.
				Rewrite your existing methods as special cases using these more configurable versions.
			</li>

	<section id="submission">
		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>
			Completing all three tasks should result in three separate Java files
			within a single package. Compress the package directory into a ZIP
			archive and <b>upload it</b> to the D2L Dropbox.  Make sure the filename
			includes your name and lab number, for example <kbd>Lab5-JohnSmith.zip</kbd>.
			In addition, <b>print out your code</b> and hand in the physical copy
			at the beginning of the next lab.
		</p>
		<p>
			The marks for this lab are heavily weighted towards good coding
			practice and style. Pay attention to each of the points in the
			table below to ensure you get a good grade!
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTE</b>: This assignment is to be done <em>individually</em>.
			You can help one another with problems and questions, but in the end
			everyone must do their own assignment.
