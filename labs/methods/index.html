		<h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>
		<p>In this lab assignment you will learn about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use of Methods to modularize programs</li>
		</ul>
		<aside>Note: for all the scenarios provided below, one or multiple methods must be used to implement the solution</aside>
	</section>

	<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Change Machine</h2>
		<p>Suppose that you want to develop a program that classifies a given amount of money into smaller monetary units. The program lets the user enter an amount as a double value representing a total dollar and cents, and outputs a report listing the monetary equivalent in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies as shown below:</p>
		<p>This program should be able to keep asking for end user for a new number to convert until a negative number is entered</p>
		<details open>
			<summary>Approach</summary>
			<ul class="instructions">
				<li>Prompt the user to enter the amount such as 11.56</li>
				<li>Convert amount into cents (1156)</li>
				<li>Divide by 100 to find dollar amount : 11</li>
				<li>Divide the remainder by 25 to find the number of quarter: 2</li>
				<li>Devide the remainder by 10 : 0 dime</li>
				<li>Devide remainder by 5: 1 nickel</li>
				<li>The remaining are pennies: 1</li>
			</ul>
		</details>
	</section>

	<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 2: Rank Teams</h2>
		<p>Using Switch statement, write a program that rank teams according to the number assigned to the classification below. The program should keep prompting the user to enter the team number, before performing the ranking , until the user enters a negative number</p>
		<ul>
			<li>7-10: Group A</li>
			<li>4-6: Group B</li>
			<li>2-3: Group C</li>
			<li>0-1: Group D</li>
			<li>Any other positive number: there no group corresponding to this number.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="task3">
		<h2>Task 3: Generate Fibonacci Numbers </h2>
		<p>Write a program that output the Fibonacci numbers that are less than the number specified by the end user. The program should keep asking for a new upper limit, until the user enters a negative number or a zero. Each Fibonacci number is the sum of its two predecessors. The first two Fibonacci number are 1 and 1. Thus the sequence begins with: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,... </p>
	</section>

	<section id="task4">
		<h2>Task 4: Lottery Game II </h2>
		<p>Expanding on the lottery program that was designed in the previous class, make some modification so that the computer can help the user guess the right number. The computer will generate a random number and give the user an opportunity to guess the number</p>
		<ul>
			<li> If the number is too low, the computer will let the user know that the number is too low and prompt the user to guess another number</li>
			<li>If the number is too high, the computer will let the user know that the number is too low and prompt the user to guess another number</li>
			<li>When the user guess the right number, the program will congratulate the user and let the user know how many trials it took for them to guess the right number, then let them know how much they won, before terminating</li>
			<li>If the user guess the right number on the first trial, the price is $10,000</li>
			<li> For any subsequent trial, the price reduces by $1,000 per trial</li>
			<li> Once the price reaches $1,000, any subsequent trial will be worth $10, when the user guess the right number </li>
		</ul>
