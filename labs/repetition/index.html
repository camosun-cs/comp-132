		<h2>Task 1: Points on a circle</h2>
		<p>
			<em>Goal:</em> create a program that will compute the <var>(x, y)</var>
			coordinates of the corner points for a regular polygon with an
			arbitrary number of sides.
			Your program should ask the user for the number of sides (or points)
			in the desired shape, and produce an ordered list of <var>(x, y)</var>
			coordinates.
		</p>
		<details>
			<summary>Sample coordinate outputs</summary>
			<p>
				The exact output from your program will depend on the coordinate
				system you choose, how large you want to make the shape, and
				how you rotate it. The sample values below assume that we're
				inscribing the polygon within a <em>unit circle</em> (a circle
				with a radius of 1) <em>centred on the origin</em>, with one
				point always fixed at <samp>(1, 0)</samp>.

			In a later lab, we'll use this information
			to draw the shape on screen, but for now let's just get the math figured out!
		</p>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>
				<p>
					When working on more complicated problems like this, it's always
					best to break the problem into smaller, simpler pieces. Start
					by writing some code that solves the problem for a triangle
					(without using any loops) and prints the coordinates of its
					three points.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are lots of ways we could solve this for a triangle,
					but we want to choose a method that will be generalizable to
					any regular polygon. One good way could be to consider the
					shape inscribed inside a circle, and use a bit of trigonometry
					on the interior angles. Other shapes would have more points at smaller
					angles around the circle, but the method for calculating
					the coordinates of each point would be the same.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="triangle.png" alt="A triangle inscribed within a unit circle" >
					<figcaption>Something like this.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					You'll need to use the
					<code class="language-java">Math.sin()</code> and
					<code class="language-java">Math.cos()</code> functions that
					are built-in to Java. These functions expect angles to be
					given in radians, so you'll probably also need the predefined
					constant <code class="language-java">Math.PI</code>.
				</p>
				<p>For example, this code:</p>
				<pre><code class="language-java">
					double result = Math.sin(Math.PI / 2);
					System.out.println(result);
				</code></pre>
				<p>Prints the value <samp>1</samp>.</p>
				<details>
					<summary>So… how do I do it?</summary>
					<p>
						First, we need to know the angles around the circle to
						get to those corners. A full circle is 360°, or 2π radians.
						A triangle has three corners, so each point is separated
						from the one before it by 120°, or 2π/3. In Java that
						looks like:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java">
						double angleBetweenPoints = 2 * Math.PI / 3;
					</code></pre>
					<p>
						To make things simple, let's use a circle with radius 1
						and rotate the shape so that the first point is at
						<var>(1, 0)</var>. No calculations needed!
					</p>
					<p>
						We can determine the coordinates of the second point
						using the <em>sine</em> and <em>cosine</em> of its
						angle away from that first point. In Java that would
						look like:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java">
						double secondPointX = Math.cos(angleBetweenPoints);
						double secondPointY = Math.sin(angleBetweenPoints);
					</code></pre>
					<p>
						The third point can be found by multiplying the angle by
						two, and using <em>sine</em> and <em>cosine</em> again.
					</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Now that you have working code for a triangle, try changing
					it to solve the problem for a square. Make note of what code
					needed to change, and what code seems to be repeated. Look
					for other small ways you could change your code to make repeated
					sections more alike.
				</p>
				<aside>
					For example, even though our first point will probably
					always the same (<samp>(1, 0)</samp>), you could calculate
					it in the same way as all of the others if you multiply
					the angle by zero.
				</aside>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Use a <code class="language-java">for</code> loop that executes
					<b>exactly four times</b> to reduce the repetition in your code.
				</p>
				<pre><code class="language-java">
					for (int point = 0; point < 4; point++) {
						// do repeated things, using the `point` number
					}
				</code></pre>
				<p>
					<code class="language-java">for</code> loops are ideal for
					creating loops with a known number of iterations, because all
					of the logic to control them is visible at the top of the loop!
				</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Why start at 0?</summary>
					<p>
						The example loop above will give you <var>point</var>
						numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3, which might seem odd at first.
						Surely they should be numbered from 1 to 4?
						However, you'll see that in this case starting from zero
						reduces the amount of code you need to write. As you get
						more practice working with loops (and arrays in a future lab)
						you'll see that this is often the case, and you'll soon
						get used to 0-based numbering!
					</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				Add some code to ask the user how many sides the shape should
				have. Use that number to calculate the angle between each point
				and to control the number of times your output loop runs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Experiment with your code to find ways to add an extra WOW
					factor! Here are a few features that could be useful that
					you can add with just a little extra math:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Translate all the output points so their coordinates are always positive</li>
					<li>Apply a user-defined rotation of the shape around its centre</li>
					<li>Scale the shape to fit a larger (or smaller) radius circle</li>
					<li>Make a second version that draws stars with the given number of points instead of regular polygons.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		<h2>Task 2: "Infinite" loops</h2>
		<ol class="instructions">
			<li>
				<p>
					Wrap your solution to <a href="#task1">Task 1</a> in an
					infinite loop so that you can use it to compute the points
					for many different shapes in a single run.
				</p>
				<details>
					<summary>How to loop forever</summary>
					<p>
						You can create a loop that will run indefinitely very simply in Java:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java">
						while (true) {
							// inside here will be repeated forever
						}
					</code></pre>
					<p>
						There are several other ways you can make an infinite loop,
						but this is the most idiomatic way that other
						programmers will recognize and will make it clear that
						you really meant to do this!
					</p>
				</details>
				<aside>
					Note: you can force your program to exit any time by choosing <samp>Run > Stop Build/Run</samp> from the main menu. If you were running your program outside of NetBeans, you could exit any time it paused for input by pressing <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd>.
				</aside>
				<details>
					<summary>What if I haven't done Task 1 yet?</summary>
					<p>
						If your code for Task 1 isn't working yet, you can start

				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				Consider which of your variables need to be freshly created
				each time your program loops, and which can be created just
				once when your program starts. Move variables outside of the
				loop if it makes sense to do so!
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Use another inifinite loop, along with conditional branches and the
					<code class="language-java">break</code>
					keyword to make sure that the user enters a usable number for
					this program (ie. an integer greater than or equal to 3) before
					trying to compute the points.
				</p>
				<details>
					<summary>Example code</summary>
					<p>This example requires the user to enter "yes" or "no" before continuing:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java">
						Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
						while (true) {
							System.out.println("Please enter 'yes' or 'no':");
							String word = input.nextLine();
							if (word.equals("yes") || word.equals("no")) {
								// input is good, stop the loop!
								System.out.println("okay!");
								break;
							} else {
								System.out.println("I don't understand...");
