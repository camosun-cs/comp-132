		<h2>Learning Outcomes and Introduction</h2>
		<p>In this lab assignment you will learn about:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Use of Looping and Repetition logic</li>
            <li>Use of<code>WHILE</code> versus <code>FOR</code> statements</li>
            <li>Use of Nested loops</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Task 1: Improved Our Lottery Program</h2>
		<p>Expand on the lottery program that was designed on the previous lab, make some modifications so that the computer can help the user guess the right number. The computer will generate a random number and give the user an opportunity to guess the right number</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the number is too low, the computer will let the user know that the number is too low and prompt the user to guess another number</li>
            <li>If the number is too high, the computer will let the user know that the number is too high and prompt the user to guess another number</li>
			<li>When the user guesses the right number, the program ocngradulate the user and let the user know how many trials it took for them to guess the right number, then let them know how much they won, before terminating</li>
            <ul>
               <li>If the user guess the right number on the first trial, the award is $10,000</li>
                <li>For any subsequent trial, the award reduces by $1000 per trial</li>
                <li>Once the award reaches $1000, any subsequent guess will be worth $10 per trial until the user guesses the right number or reaches the maximum.</li>

		<h2>Task 2: Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
		<p>write a program that output the Fibonacci numbers that are less than 30,000.  Each FIbonacci number is the sum of its two predecessors.  The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1.  Thus the sequence begins with 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...</p>

			Completing <a href="#task1">Task 1</a>, <a href="#task2">Task 2</a> 
            and <a href="#task3">Task 3</a> should result in three separate Java files 
            within a single package.
        <b>Compress</b> the package directory into a ZIP archive, rename it as <samp>
    Lab4-FirstnameLastname.zip</samp>, and </br><b>upload it</b> to the D2L
			Dropbox.  In addition, <b>print out your code</b> and hand in the physical copy
			at the beginning of the next lab.

			The marks for this lab are heavily weighted towards good coding
			practice and style. Pay attention to each of the points in the
			table below to ensure you get a good grade!

		   <b>NOTE</b>: This assignment is to be done <em>individually</em>.
		   You can help one another with problems and questions, but in the end
		   everyone must do their own assignment.
