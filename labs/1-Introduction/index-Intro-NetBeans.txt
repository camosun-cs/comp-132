One of the folder is called src. This folder contains .java file. This is the file you created in the previous step. It is known as the source codeo Go to the menu Run-->Compile File. Check in the output tab ( in the bottom section of NetBeans and confirm that you have a message saying BUILD SUCESSFULLY. If you have syntax error in your code, the output will indicate this.o Check the project folder again, and notice a “build” folder that has been added. Open the “build” folder, then “classes” folder. This folder contain the .class file. These file is the java bytecode. This is the code that will run in the virtual machine when you run your java programo The difference between .class and .java will be explain in the course of the semestero To run your program within NetBeans, go to menu Run --> Run Project. Notice the outcome in the output output window. It should readHello WorldThis is my first Java ProgramSubmit your project to D2Lo Option 1* Zip the entire project folder and submit the zipped file to the dropboxo Option 2* Go File -->Export Project -->to Zip, select the destination and name of the zip file	* Submit the zip file to D2LPractice Exercise: Create your First Java ProgramCreate a java program whose output should contain the following* My name is “FirstName “  “Last Name”* I am taking this class because I ……(fill in blank)* I am hoping to learn … in this class (fill in the blank)Create the appropriate project and file. Test your program and upload your project to D2L dropbox under Lab 1 – Intro to NetBeans folder [Type text]0[Type text]0[Type text]0Lab 1: Introduction to NetBeans 1
